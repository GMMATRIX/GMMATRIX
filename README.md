Wassup everyone!

I'm GM|Matrix, a high schooler passionate about programming.

So far, I have learned Python, Java, C++, and Javascript. I am well familiar with HTML and CSS. I have made over 20 games so far (a few of which will be released here) and 
have made websites for several organizations.

I am always ready to learn more about programming in the tech world. Feel free to reach out to me here on Git Hub.

Happy Coding!
