👋Yo what's up. I'm GM|Matrix. 

And I am currently a 10th grader. I am a sincere and intellignet child that loves to program. 

So far I have mastered the Python programming langauge🐍 and have moved onto exploring the world of Java☕. I have gained a strong stance in developing webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript💻. 

Soon I will be playing with robots🤖 and hardware to really get a good idea in the world of computers.

I look forward to communicate with anyone that just wants to talk. If anyone could share ideas or suggestions, that would be cool. 

If you wish to communicate, then please contact me at my email. Thank you!

See Y'all!
